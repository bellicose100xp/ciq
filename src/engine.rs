//! Engine box — the swappable query engine behind a single trait.
//!
//! Canonical per `dev/PLAN.md` §0/D1. The rest of ciq talks to `dyn QueryEngine` and never
//! knows whether it's the real DuckDB engine or the in-memory `FakeEngine` used by tests —
//! this is the seam that keeps the worker/dispatcher/grid/autocomplete layers headless-
//! testable with zero DuckDB dependency, and that makes a future DataFusion swap a one-module
//! change.
//!
//! Conventions (jiq-inherited): no `mod.rs`; the trait lives here directly (avoiding a
//! same-name inner module); result types in `engine/types.rs`; impls in their own submodules
//! as they land (`duckdb_engine`, `fake_engine`).

/// - **`query` takes no cancel argument** — cancellation is out-of-band (§0/D4): the worker
///   blocks here and cannot watch a token; the dispatcher interrupts via `interrupt_handle()`.
/// - **`load` is the only `Result<_, EngineError>` surface** — a genuine ingest failure
///   (unreadable/again-malformed file, OOM) *is* exceptional.
/// - **`&self` on `query`/`distinct`** — DuckDB's `Connection` uses interior mutability, so
///   the worker can issue queries through a shared reference while the dispatcher holds an
///   `InterruptHandle` clone.
