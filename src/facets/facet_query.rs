//! Facet SQL builder — `build_facet_sql(col, &Schema) -> String` (`dev/PLAN.md` §6.5).
//!
//! Pressing the facet chord on the focused grid column fires a single cheap aggregate against the
//! **already-loaded** table `t` (DuckDB distinct/group-by at ~10-15 ms on 5M rows — the reason
//! DuckDB was chosen over Polars). This module emits the SQL; the worker runs it on the same
//! channel/engine as the main query (§6.5 — no second connection), and [`facet_state`] parses the
//! resulting [`Table`](crate::engine::Table) back into a [`FacetResult`](super::facet_state::FacetResult).
//!
//! **Type-aware shape** (so the parser can interpret the result by the column's type):
//!  - **Numeric / temporal / bool / other** → one **summary** row of four aggregate columns:
//!    `mn` (MIN), `mx` (MAX), `distinct_count` (COUNT DISTINCT), `null_count`
//!    (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE col IS NULL)).
//!  - **Text** → a **top-K** result: one `(value, n)` row per most-frequent value (the GROUP BY
//!    histogram), with the column-wide `distinct_count` / `null_count` carried on every row as
//!    correlated scalar sub-selects so the single returned `Table` holds everything the popup needs.
//!
//! Pure `&str` → `String`: it runs nothing. The exact emitted SQL — including the quoting of a
//! column literally named `order` or one containing a `"` — is golden-tested without DuckDB
//! ([`facet_query_tests`]). Identifiers are quoted through the shared [`crate::sql_ident::quote_ident`]
//! so quoting can never drift from the other emitters.
