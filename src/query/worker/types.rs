//! Worker channel types: `QueryRequest`, `QueryResponse`, and `ProcessedResult`.
//!
//! The worker contract is reused from jiq (`dev/PLAN.md` §3.2) — a `QueryRequest` goes out, a
//! `QueryResponse::{ProcessedSuccess, Error, Cancelled}` comes back, each carrying a
//! `request_id` for stale-discard. ciq diverges on two settled points:
//!
//! - **No `cancel_token` on `QueryRequest`** (§0/D4). Cancellation is out-of-band: the
//!   dispatcher holds an [`InterruptHandle`](crate::engine::InterruptHandle) clone and calls
//!   `.interrupt()` from its own thread when a newer `request_id` supersedes the in-flight
//!   query. The worker only ever blocks in `engine.query()` and returns `Cancelled`.
//! - **`ProcessedResult` carries tabular data, not JSON** (§0/S6): the columnar [`Table`] of
//!   rows, the result [`Schema`], and the redacted-from-snapshots `execution_time_ms`. jiq's
//!   JSON-only `parsed` field is dropped, and no pre-laid-out grid is carried: the App re-lays
//!   out from `rows` against the *real* terminal viewport on every frame (resize reflow without
//!   re-querying), so a worker-side grid against a fixed viewport would be thrown away. Anything
//!   the grid would derive (row count, widths) comes from `rows`, so storing it would be
//!   redundant denormalized state.
